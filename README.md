## formal specification using petri-net:

Using petri-net we formally specfied this system :

A petri-net for 4 traffic lights 

This petri net ensures that each traffic light work on its own without interubting other traffic light . 

The first 2 traffic lights in the first path are allowed to be green at the same time while the rest is red .

The second 2 traffic lights in path 2 are allowed to be green at the same time while the rest are red .

The third traffic light in the 3rd path is allowed to be green while the rest are red .

The forth traffic light in the forth path is allowed to be green while the rest are red .
